# Game of Life - Java Project

## Overview

This project is a Java implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a cellular automaton where each "cell" (represented by a tile) lives or dies based on specific rules. The project uses **multithreading**, where each tile runs as an independent thread, updating its state based on its neighbors.

The game is displayed using a graphical interface created with **Java Swing**, and the state of each tile is updated and painted dynamically.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface**: The game board is rendered in a window using `JPanel`, with live cells shown as black squares and dead cells shown as white.
- **Multithreading**: Each tile runs on its own thread, independently updating its state based on the status of its neighboring cells.
- **Start/Stop Controls**: The game can be started and paused using the buttons in the graphical interface.
- **Game of Life Rules**: Each tile follows the standard Game of Life rules:
  - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
  - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GameOfLife.git
    ```

2. **Compile the project**:

    If you're using a command-line environment, you can compile the project by navigating to the project directory and running:

    ```bash
    javac GameWindow.java GameBoard.java Tile.java
    ```

3. **Run the project**:

    Once compiled, you can run the project with:

    ```bash
    java GameWindow
    ```

4. **Alternatively, use an IDE**:

    You can also open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Simply import the files into the IDE and run the `GameWindow` class.

## How It Works

### Main Components:

1. **GameWindow.java**:
   - This class sets up the main window of the game.
   - It creates and manages buttons (`Start` and `Stop`) and the game board (`GameBoard`).
   - Handles the user interaction for starting and stopping the game.

2. **GameBoard.java**:
   - This class manages the grid of `Tile` objects (representing cells).
   - It propagates the "start" and "stop" signals to each tile by controlling whether each tile thread is running or paused.

3. **Tile.java**:
   - Each tile (or cell) represents an individual unit of the Game of Life grid.
   - The `run()` method in each `Tile` is responsible for updating the state of that tile in its thread.
   - The `Tile` also handles painting itself on the graphical interface.

### Controls:

- **Start Button**: Begins or resumes the game. Each tile thread will start running, updating its state based on the state of neighboring tiles.
- **Stop Button**: Pauses the game. All tile threads stop updating, freezing the current state of the grid.

## Customization

- **Grid Size**: The grid size is currently set to `50x50` in `GameBoard.java`. You can modify this by adjusting the `Tile[][]` array size and the layout in the constructor of `GameBoard`.
- **Update Speed**: The update speed for each tile is controlled by the `Thread.sleep()` method in `Tile.java`. You can adjust the sleep duration to change how fast the game runs.
- **Initial State**: The initial state of each tile is determined randomly. You can customize the starting configuration by modifying the constructor of `Tile`.

## Future Improvements

- Add options to customize the initial configuration (random, predefined patterns, etc.).
- Implement a speed control slider to allow users to adjust the speed of the simulation dynamically.
- Add saving/loading functionality to save and restore specific game states.
